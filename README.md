`Text::KnuthPlass` is a Perl and XS (C) implementation of the well-known 
Knuth-Plass TeX paragraph-shaping (a.k.a. line-breaking) algorithm, as created
by Donald E. Knuth and Michael F. Plass in 1981.

Given a long string containing the text of a paragraph, this module decides
where to split a line (possibly hyphenating a word in the process), while
attempting to:

* maintain text "tightness" within a reasonable, comfortably readable, range (neither jammed together nor excessively loose).
* maintain fairly consistent text "tightness" (limited change from line to line).
* minimize the amount of hyphenation overall (words split at a line end).

What is a stated objective of Knuth-Plass but I **don't** think this implementation directly does:

* minimize the number of lines resulting.
* not have two or more hyphenated lines in a row.
* not have entire words "floating" over the next line (particularly when not fully justified, e.g., "ragged right").
* not hyphenate the paragraph's penultimate line.

What it definitely **doesn't** do:

* attempt to avoid widows and orphans. This is the job of the calling routine, as `Text::KnuthPlass` doesn't know how much of the paragraph fits on this page (or column) and how much has to be spilled to the next page or column. It simply splits up the entire paragraph, and leaves it to your code to render.
* attempt to avoid hyphenating the last word of the last line of a _split_ paragraph on a page or column (as before, it doesn't know where you're going to be splitting the paragraph between columns or pages).
* attempt to optimize over an entire _page_ (it handles one paragraph at a time).
* avoid having the same word (or fragment) starting or ending two lines in a row (a "stack"). This is undesirable because it makes it easier to mistrack while reading, and accidentally skip up or down a line.
* avoid near-vertical "rivers" of whitespace.
* avoid a very short or single word last line (a "cub").

In spite of these limitations, the Knuth-Plass ("TeX line splitting") algorithm
is still pretty much the gold standard for paragraph shaping.

The Knuth-Plass algorithm does this by defining "boxes", "glue", and
"penalties" for the paragraph text, and fiddling with line break points to
minimize the overall sum of demerits (a penalty value for various "bad
typesetting" gaffes). This can result in the "breaking" of one
or more of the listed rules, if it results in an overall better scoring 
("better looking") layout.

`Text::KnuthPlass` handles word widths by either character count, or a
user-supplied width function (such as based on the current font and font
size). It can also handle varying-length lines, if your column is not a
perfect rectangle (see examples).

## Installation

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

Note that if the XS (C) code fails to build and install for some reason, or
you enjoy watching paint dry, you
can still run "pure Perl" code -- it's much slower, but will always run. In
lib/Text/KnuthPlass.pm, look for the flag setting
`use constant purePerl => 0;` and change it to a value of `1`.

## Documentation

After installation, documentation can be found via

    perldoc Text::KnuthPlass

or

    pod2html lib/Text/KnuthPlass.pm > KnuthPlass.html

## Support

Bug tracking is via

    "https://github.com/PhilterPaper/Text-KnuthPlass/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aopen"

(you will need a GitHub account to create a ticket, or contribute to a
discussion, but anyone can read tickets.) The old RT ticket system is closed.

Do NOT under ANY circumstances open a PR (Pull Request) to report a _bug_. It
is a waste of both your and our time and effort. A PR is an offering of code
that you think belongs permanently in the product. Instead, open a regular
ticket (issue), and attach a Perl (.pl) program illustrating the problem, if
possible. If you believe that you have a good program patch, and offer to share
it as a PR, we may give the go-ahead. Unsolicited PRs may be closed without
further action.

## History

Around 2009, Bram Stein wrote a Javascript implementation of the Knuth-Plass
paragraph fitting algorithm named `typeset` (not to be confused with the
language `typescript`, nor the publishing system `Typeset`). It may be found
on GitHub in `bramstein/typeset`, and does not appear to be maintained (last
update 2017). In 2011, Simon Cozens ported `typeset` to Perl, and called it
`Text::KnuthPlass`, maintaining it for only a short time. In 2020, Phil Perry
took over maintenance of this package.

**Note**:  gitpan/Text-KnuthPlass (on GitHub) appears to be a Read-Only
archive of Text::KnuthPlass from _before_ Perry took over maintenance. It is
old, and thus not very useful. See PhilterPaper/Text-KnuthPlass for the latest
code.

There are many copies of the Knuth-Plass paper/thesis, as well as discussions
and explanations of the algorithm, floating around on the Web, so I will leave
it to you to find some examples. Just the keywords _Knuth_ and _Plass_ should
get you there.

There is also a refactored (still Javascript) version of
`typeset`, intended for use as a library, in `frobnitzem/typeset`.
Finally, there are a
number of Knuth-Plass implementations in other languages, such as Python
(`akuchling/texlib`) and typescript (`avery-laird/breaker`) that could be
studied. And of course, there is the original Knuth-Plass paper and the
annotated listing in _TeX: The Program_. It's just a matter of finding the
time to go through all these sources and extend `Text::KnuthPlass` in
various ways.

## An Example

Find an example of using Text::KnuthPlass in `examples/PDF/Flatland.pl`,
derived from the example in _typeset_. It
assumes that Text::Hyphen and PDF::Builder are installed. You can easily
substitute PDF::API2 and change the PDF::Builder references in the code. You
can change many settings, such as the font, font size, indentation amount,
leading, line length (in Points), and whether output is flush right or ragged
right. The output file is `Flatland.pdf`.

There are more examples, including `KP.pl` and `Triangle.pl`, both giving some
usage examples to get various effects, for a variety of input texts. Both PDF
and text file outputs are produced.
