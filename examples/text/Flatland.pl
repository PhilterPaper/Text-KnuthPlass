#!/usr/bin/Perl
# stolen from bramstein/typset (JS source of Text::KnuthPlass) package
# REQUIRES PDF::Builder and Text::Hyphen (builds PDF output)
# Note that the code is not terribly robust, e.g., if a paragraph spills over
#   to the next page, any image within that paragraph will not be properly
#   placed. Therefore there is a lot of hand-tuning on placing images.
# TBD: command-line selection of line width
#      Outdented paragraph example
# TBD: pass indent value, create box (space) with that width. then can
#     pass normal length lines in list. also pass scalar 'linelength' to use
#       if list is empty
#     HOW best to span short line list across multiple paragraphs? w/o manual 
#       update
#     can we just set globals once in new() and keep reusing $t with repeated
#       calls to $t->typeset()? have indent=>0 override at section start
#       as well as a new call for line lengths array?
#     a "last line on page" to show where paragraph is expected to be split
#
# TBD: not yet complete, shows XS problem with line-length array (TBF)
# NOTE: Javascript version indents by gluing a 30px wide empty box to the
#         start of a paragraph (but not the first in a section)
#       <img> in JS done at top of a paragraph, and N lines (N based on height
#         of image) pushed onto any existing line length list, with width 
#         reduction figured from image width. of course, needs a working LL!
#         Pure Perl LL is working, just XS needs fix
# compare to bramstein/typset examples/flatland/index.html
# compare to                  #22 bad line-breaking
